Nextcloud Simple Installation and Tips

I was origionally trying a few years back to try to set up a server.
I wanted a very simple way to set it up.  Origionally I used OwnCloud
which is where Nextcloud forked from.

OwnCloud was great.  However, even though the setup was not too difficult,
I found an easier solution with Nextcloud.
