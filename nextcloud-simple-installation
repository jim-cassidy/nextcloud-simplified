Nextcloud Simple Installation and Tips

I was origionally trying a few years back to try to set up a server.
I wanted a very simple way to set it up.  Origionally I used OwnCloud
which is where Nextcloud forked from.

OwnCloud was great.  However, even though the setup was not too difficult,
I found an easier solution with Nextcloud.

So what made it easier for me?
Snap!

Snap automated a lot of details.


Update as usual:

sudo apt update

Install snap

sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install core
sudo snap refresh core

Install nextcloud:

sudo snap install nextcloud

login:
http://localhost:port#


Of course it isn't completely that simple. There are other more difficult tasks.
I wanted to add a USB terabye drive. In a different tutorial I will give steps.
